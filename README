link-crew.sh

Written By: Braden Carlson

DESCRIPTION

    This script was intended to be used for the link crew program at Lewiston High School, and 
aims to solve a few data processing problems that are frequently encountered.  

    The main problem that this script solves is as follows.  There exists some master list
of students attending the school, which contains other information about each student,
such as their home room teacher and classroom, parent's email, grade, etc. Then there is
also another file (which I have typically called the accepted and recommended files) of
students who have either been recommeded for the program or already accepted. The task is
to take the list of recommended students and search for their name in the master file.
This serves two purposes, we can then obtain their parents email and any other information
about the student from the master file, and any names that are not found in the master
list are the only ones that need to be done by hand. 

    Since this is the main task that needs to be performed, any lists of names (such as
recommeded and accepted files) should be cleaned before being compared with with the
master file. This means that lists of names should not contain extra spaces, and all names
should properly captilalized.  The spacing problem needs to be handled with some other
tool (I prefer sed!). This script does provide a method to fix capitalization mistakes in
a file. The way this is done is the script capitalizes every word in the file, so this
should only be done on lists which only contain names.  

EXAMPLES

Use accepted.txt as the list of accepted students, recommended.txt as the 
list of the recommended students, and find the students who are on the 
recommended list but not on the accepted list. 

    link-crew.sh -a accepted.txt -r recommended.txt -d recommended - accepted

Just as the previous example, but print the MATCHING names (that is, the names 
on recommended which are found in accepted) to the file matches.txt

    link-crew.sh -a accepted.txt -r recommended.txt -d recommended - accepted --match matches.txt

The --no-match option is used in the same was as the --match option, but prints the 
names that are normally printed to the screen to the file provided. 

Fix the capitalization of the list of students in the accepted.txt file. 

    link-crew.sh -c accepted.txt

Fix the capitalization of the list of students in the accepted.txt file, and make 
a backup of the original.

    link-crew.sh --backup -c accepted.txt

or

    link-crew.sh -c accepted.txt --backup
