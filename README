link-crew.sh

Written By: Braden Carlson

DESCRIPTION

This script was intended to be used for the link crew 
program at Lewiston High School, and aims to solve a few 
data processing problems that are frequently encountered.  

EXAMPLES

Use accepted.txt as the list of accepted students, recommended.txt as the 
list of the recommended students, and find the students who are on the 
recommended list but not on the accepted list. 

    link-crew.sh -a accepted.txt -r recommended.txt -d recommended - accepted

Just as the previous example, but print the MATCHING names (that is, the names 
on recommended which are found in accepted) to the file matches.txt

    link-crew.sh -a accepted.txt -r recommended.txt -d recommended - accepted --match matches.txt

The --no-match option is used in the same was as the --match option, but prints the 
names that are normally printed to the screen to the file provided. 

Fix the capitalization of the list of students in the accepted.txt file. 

    link-crew.sh -c accepted.txt

Fix the capitalization of the list of students in the accepted.txt file, and make 
a backup of the original.

    link-crew.sh --backup -c accepted.txt

or

    link-crew.sh -c accepted.txt --backup
